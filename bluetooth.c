 * File        : bluetooth.c
 * Project     : Bluetooth-Based Secure Locker with Access Logging
 * Description : Receives password commands from an HC-05 Bluetooth-to-serial
 *               module over UART1, using an interrupt service routine so
 *               the main loop never has to block waiting on individual
 *               bytes.
 *
 * HC-05 wiring (over UART1):
 *   HC-05 RXD <- P0.8  (LPC2148 TXD1)
 *   HC-05 TXD -> P0.9  (LPC2148 RXD1)
 *   HC-05 VCC -> 5V (module has its own onboard regulator/level shifting)
 *   HC-05 GND -> GND
 *
 * Protocol: the paired mobile phone/app sends the password digits followed
 * by a '#' terminator, e.g. "1234#". Any trailing carriage return / line
 * feed characters that the app appends after sending are ignored by the
 * receiver (see UART1_ISR below for why this matters).

 * automatically append a trailing CR and/or LF after the text you send,
 * in addition to the '#' you typed (e.g. sending "1234#" actually
 * transmits '1','2','3','4','#','\n'). If that trailing '\n' were also
 * treated as a terminator, it would arrive in its own interrupt shortly
 * after the '#' - before the main loop (which only polls every 100 ms)
 * has had a chance to read the buffer - and would immediately overwrite
 * the just-received command with an empty string, making every correct
 * password look like "Access Denied". Treating '#' as the only
 * terminator, and simply discarding CR/LF bytes, avoids that. */
