 * File        : delay.c
 * Project     : Bluetooth-Based Secure Locker with Access Logging
 * Description : Blocking delay routines built on the LPC2148's Timer0,
 *               used throughout the project (LCD timing, keypad debounce,
 *               I2C timing, buzzer patterns, motor run time, etc).
 *
 * PCLK is assumed to be 15 MHz (see the PLL configuration in
 * projectmain.c). Timer0 is configured in timer mode with a prescaler
 * (T0PR) chosen so that T0TC increments once per millisecond or once per
 * microsecond, letting the delay simply be "wait until T0TC reaches the
 * requested count".
 *
 * T0CTCR = 0x00 -> Timer0 counts PCLK cycles (timer mode, not counter mode)
 * T0TCR  = 0x02 -> Reset the timer counter and prescale counter
 * T0TCR  = 0x01 -> Enable (start) the timer counter
