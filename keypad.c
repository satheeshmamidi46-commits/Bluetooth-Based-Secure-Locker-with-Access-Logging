 * File        : keypad.c
 * Project     : Bluetooth-Based Secure Locker with Access Logging
 * Description : Driver for a standard 4x4 matrix keypad used to enter the
 *               Level-2 password and to operate the admin menu.
 *
 * Wiring (all on GPIO Port 1):
 *   Rows (driven as outputs) -> P1.16, P1.17, P1.18, P1.19
 *   Cols (read as inputs, pulled up externally) -> P1.20, P1.21, P1.22, P1.23
 *
 * Scanning method: rows are held HIGH, then one row at a time is pulled
 * LOW; if a key in that row is pressed, its column line will read LOW.
